## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm learning how to complete coding challenges. I'm working on developing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The challenge wasn't clear which elements to make interactive on hover, so I added a hover state to the card (cursor: pointer) and to the blog preview title (text: underline).

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on accessibility and correct semantics in future projects. These are concepts and techniques I'm still working on developing.
